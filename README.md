# Switch-Implementation
This repository contains an implementation of a network switch that features basic MAC learning and frame forwarding, as well as support for VLAN segmentation. It also includes a simplified version of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to prevent network loops by periodically exchanging BPDU messages and updating the optimal path to the root bridge.
